Source code for JWST/NIRISS

This code base contains tool for generating synthetic data and extracting
stellar spectrum for the slitless spectrometer (NIRISS) for JWST.

The easiest way to compile the code is:

./configure
make all

To compile everything you need:  X11, PGPlot and CFITSIO.  If you don't 
have these requirements 'configure' will fail.  I have been using the 
Intel compiler (ifort) but gfortran should work fine.

There are currently 3 Projects in 3 seperate directories.

*limbdark*

   calcldco.f90: uses ATLAS-9 synethetic spectrum to generate limb-darkening
   co-efficients on a line-by-line basis.  The model output is then 
   used by the synthetic image generator to produce realistic time-
   series data for transit spectroscopy.
   
   
*specextract*

   specextract.90: currently uses synthetic spectrum as input.  Generates
   a trace for each order and performs a simple aperture extraction.
   This code code is under rapid development:
     -will measure dispersion angle
     -add drizzle extraction
     -add PSF modeling for overlapping orders
     
*spgen*

   spgen.f90: generates synthetic images based on convolution of a model
   spectrum with model PSF.  Currently generates 3-orders.
   This code is also under development
      -add n=0 order 
      -add tools for noise models
      -make tool for generating time-series data
